**introduction**

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

**Target of this project**

We need to perform clustering to summarize customer segments.


using heat map we visualize the correlation between features which from it we deduced the intersts of customers.

from this map we can deduce:

*wines is the top in money spent after it the meat .

*they are followed by fish with 64%

*then sweet and fruits are equal with 61%

*and finally the gold with 53% .




**results of project**

using kmeans algorithm we made four clusters (Silver , gold , platinium and bronze ) 
and also we deduced:

*most of customers are university graduates  

*most of customers are living with a partener

*the range of age among customers between 40 and 65

*Most of the customers are earning between 25000 and 85000

*each cluster spends according to his earning of money .


*with more income the more spending money


*On the basis of income and total spendings, customers are divided into 4 clusters i.e. Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze


*Most of the customers fall into the Silver and Gold categories


*wine and meat are most popular products among all clusters


*Platinum customers showed more acceptance towards promotion campaigns while bronze customers the least interest.
